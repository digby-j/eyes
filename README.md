## Introduction

This repo explores javascript functionality with arrays and setTimeout, on click a pacman icon will move across the screen, then change directions when it detects the edge of the screen.

## Installation

Thanks for taking interest in my repo! If you would like to download this content please do so, you can find instructions below. If you wish to fork this content please consider Staring the repo.

Please ensure the files are all downladed into the same root direcotry, this will allow you to deploy it locally and interact with the webpage as if it were hosted on Pages.

## Road Map

I would like to add button to the ui and allow the player more control over pacman or how many there are on screen.
